# MNIST-Deep-Learning 
get hands dirty with the famous digit recognition problem using the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database

1. Experimented with Convolution, Pooling, ImageGenerator using Tensorflow on MNIST dataset
   (MNIST Classification using Tensorflow.ipynb)
2. MNIST Classification using Pytorch

   Bhawna's Task - understand and run codes for MNIST NN code using pytorch, MNIST code using JAX by 8th July
, MNIST using QNN by 10th July
