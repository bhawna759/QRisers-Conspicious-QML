# MNIST-Deep-Learning 
get hands dirty with the famous digit recognition problem using the MNIST (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology) database

The MNIST database contains binary images of handwritten digits commonly used to train image processing systems. The digits were collected from among Census Bureau employees and high school students. The database contains 60,000 training digits and 10,000 testing digits, all of which have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image of 28 Ã— 28 pixels. 

1. Experimented with Convolution, Pooling, ImageGenerator using Tensorflow on MNIST dataset
   (MNIST Classification using Tensorflow.ipynb)
2. MNIST Classification using Pytorch

   Bhawna's Task - understand and run codes for MNIST NN code using pytorch, MNIST code using JAX by 8th July
, MNIST using QNN by 10th July
